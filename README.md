## The Process and What I have learned

### The Process
<p>
  This is a web crawler I wrote for my internship. The previous crawler was not working anymore due to the web interface update, 
  so I wrote a new one to scrape the real estate transaction data.
</p>

### Lesson Learned
<p>
This was the first web crawler I ever wrote! It was definitely challenging to learn what is a web crawler and how to write in two days. I had to learn Selenium in a day, and I remember reading the documentation and watching many YouTube tutorials. I also looked at the previous web crawler to understand exactly what data and how it scraped because this web crawler would be reused again unless the website changes its interface.  
</p>
<p>
I had a challenging time understanding the previous crawler, but I could read the overall process or the big picture by researching and asking my colleague and manager. 
</p>
<p>
The crawler needed to partition the date period, such as three days for Manhattan, five days for Queens, etc., because the website did not allow extracting more than 500 transaction data at a time. Because there were many transactions every day in New York City, I also needed to break the search by the neighborhoods and building types. Also, I used Google API to clean and unify the addresses to the same format. 
</p>
<p>
Completing this project, I learned to understand the topic and start working on the project quickly. Unlike working on personal projects, I don't get to take time to learn things, but I need to learn and adapt quickly to complete the tasks given to me. 
</p>
<p>
I found that it is crucial to keep myself up-to-date, such as understanding my responsibilities within the company and improving the technical skills needed. For example, suppose web scraping is one of my main duties, and the company is using a specific Python library to scrap data. In that case, I should study and learn more about it even though I might not use it the next day. Because there are so many things to know, I always need to study and learn on my own time.
